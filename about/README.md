# About
G<b>®</b> is a greatest invention in the era of scientific instrumentation and genius engineering, equipped with robotics as  an ignited intelligent machine — especially designed, crafted, moulded and created for the scientists by the scientists and the neurones are programmed by it's father to provide the capability of carrying out a complex series of actions to do the storage of molecules, automatically.

It is an autonomous — designed and fabricated to do an intelligent interventions, when needed by the humans.
