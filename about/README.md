# About
G<b>®</b> is a greatest invention in the era of scientific instrumentation and genius engineering, equipped with robotics as  an ignited intelligent machine — especially designed, crafted, moulded and created for the scientists by the scientists and the neurones are programmed by it's father to provide the capability of carrying out a complex series of actions to do the storage of molecules, automatically.

It is an autonomous — designed and fabricated to do an intelligent interventions, when needed by the humans. It can be guided by an external extreme control device that is an advanced state-of-the-art hardware and coupled with the in-built smart intelligent software to do the each and every tasks/operations of G<b>®</b>.

G<b>®</b> is manufactured to do the storage and guided repetitive tasks, when needed by the experimental scientists, anytime — duration of storage is very little and speed is ultrafast, because it's just not a robot — it's an Intelligent Interactive Molecule Storage Environment (IIMSE).

G<b>®</b> can be armed with it's own sister construct <b>∞</b>.IIRE — the available style (<b>∞<sup>Ψ.<i>n</i></sup></b>, where <i>n</i> = 1, 2, 4, 9) is totally dedicated to storing the molecules.
