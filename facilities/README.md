# G<sup>®</sup> — Facilities
G<sup>®</sup> is a molecule storage facility, that build up for read/write and store easily for the future science.

G have two classes, and four style of storage facilities.

<b>Define Equation:</b> In G®, the equation is constrained to absolute, itself.

G<sub>Style</sub> = x<sup>y</sup>

1. Array, where x<sup>y</sup>, if x = 4, y = n => m

2. Cluster, where x<sup>y</sup>, if x = 4, y = n => m

3. Matrix, where x<sup>y</sup>, if x = 9, y = 

4. Quad, where x<sup>y</sup>, if x = 4, y = 4 => 16
