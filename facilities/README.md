# G<sup>®</sup> — Facilities
G<sup>®</sup> is a molecule storage facility, that build up for read/write and store easily for the future experimental science.

G have two classes, and four style of storage facilities.

<b>Define Equation:</b> In G®, the equation is constrained to absolute, itself.

G<sub>Style</sub> = x<sup>y</sup>

- Class
  - Robotics
  - Non-Robotics
 
- Style — G have four style of design, to provide smart way to build the perfect future of experimental science.

1. Array, where x<sup>y</sup>, if x = j, y = k => m

2. Cluster, where x<sup>y</sup>, if x = 9, y = 4 => 6561

3. Matrix, where x<sup>y</sup>, if x = 4, y = 4 => 256

4. Quad, where x<sup>y</sup>, if x = 4, y = 2 => 16

## [1.] G<sub><sup>Quad</sup></sub>
Quad is a spun-off engineering of the Sequomics, Inc. and to deal with operational molecular sciences. Quad is a base style of non-robotics based molecule storage facility, equipped with () intelligent molecular storage environment. Quad is designed with experience to give a smart way to reduce the time of doing the fascinating research, in the field of experimental sciences. Quad is assembled for personal use, the reason is very ignited simple — to do the most advanced research at the workbench.

Storage Formula = () × () => Samples.
 If 1, it is 16,
    2, it is 32,
    4, it is 64,
    9, it is 144.

Quad is a best possible friend for a personal use, right.

## [2.] G<sub><sup>Matrix</sup></sub>
If 1, it is 256,
   2, it is 512,
   4, it is 1024,
   9, it is 2304.
   
## [3.] G<sub><sup>Cluster</sup></sub>
If 1, it is 6561,
   2, it is 13,122,
   4, it is 26,244,
   9, it is 59,049.

## [4.] G<sub><sup>Array</sup></sub>
If 1, it is — please let me explain.
