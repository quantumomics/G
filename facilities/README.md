# G<sup>®</sup> — Facilities
G<sup>®</sup> is a molecule storage facility, that build up for read/write and store easily for the future experimental science.

G<sup>®</sup> have two class(s), and four style(s) of the storage facilities.

<b>Define Equation:</b> In G®, the equation is constrained to absolute, itself.

G<sub>Style</sub> = x<sup>y</sup>

- Class
  - Robotics
  - Non-Robotics
 
- Style — G have four style of design, to provide smart way to build the perfect future of experimental science.

1. Array, where x<sup>y</sup>, if x = j, y = k => m

2. Cluster, where x<sup>y</sup>, if x = 9, y = 4 => 6561

3. Matrix, where x<sup>y</sup>, if x = 4, y = 4 => 256

4. Quad, where x<sup>y</sup>, if x = 4, y = 2 => 16

## [1.] G<sub><sup>Quad</sup></sub>
Quad is a spun-off engineering of the Sequomics, Inc. and to deal with operational molecular sciences. Quad is a base style of non-robotics based molecule storage facility, equipped with () intelligent molecular storage environment. Quad is designed with experience to give a smart way to reduce the time of doing the fascinating research, in the field of experimental sciences. Quad is assembled for the personal use, the reason is very ignited simple — to do the most advanced research at the workbench.

Storage Formula = [<b>x<sup><i>y</i></sup></b>] × [<b>∞<sup>Ψ.<b><i>n</i></b></sup></b>] => Samples.</br>
                              |                                 |</br>
Storage Formula = [<b>x<sup><i>y</i></sup></b>] × [<b>∞<sup>Ψ.<b><i>n</i></b></sup></b>] => Samples.</br>

Where, <b><i>n</i></b> = 1, 2, 4, 9.

If <b><i>n</i></b> = 1; Then 16 × 1 = 16 units</br>
ElseIf <b><i>n</i></b> = 2, Then 16 × 2 = 32 units</br>
ElseIf <b><i>n</i></b> = 4, Then 16 × 4 = 64 units</br>
ElseIf <b><i>n</i></b> = 9, Then 16 × 9 = 144 units</br>

<i>Quad is a best possible friend for a personal use, right</i>.

## [2.] G<sub><sup>Matrix</sup></sub>
If 1, it is 256,
   2, it is 512,
   4, it is 1024,
   9, it is 2304.
   
## [3.] G<sub><sup>Cluster</sup></sub>
If 1, it is 6561,
   2, it is 13,122,
   4, it is 26,244,
   9, it is 59,049.

## [4.] G<sub><sup>Array</sup></sub>
If 1, it is — please let me explain.
